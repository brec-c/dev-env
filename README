run this from anywhere:

curl https://raw.github.com/jaymedavis/dev-env/master/install.sh | sh

this script will
1) clone this repo into your Sublime packages folder
2) delete Preferences.sublime-settings from User and symlink the one in the repo

if you want to use this, I would recommend forking it and changing
1) the git clone path in the install.sh script
2) the curl url points to your install.sh on github
